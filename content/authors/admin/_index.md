Alex Gagliano is a first-year graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He currently studies the relationship between supernovae and their host galaxies with Dr. Gautham Narayan in preparation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). He also works with colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory on combining cosmology simulations with inline chemical networks to study the early evolution of complex molecules.

Alex is passionate about astronomy outreach and developing tools to make astronomy accessible to all. With post-doc Karelle Siellez and professor Matt Turk, he is constructing a set of sound and touch-based astronomy demonstrations to share the excitement of LIGO's discoveries over the last 5 years.
