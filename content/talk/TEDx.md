abstract = "If art inspires us to help others see, then, as Plato said, “Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.” Alex Gagliano wants to compel us to appreciate the stars and their connection to us in his talk 'Looking out to Look in.' Alex is an undergraduate from Virginia Tech studying Computational Modeling & Data Analytics, with a minor in International Studies. He is fascinated with the intersection between astronomy and the arts, as well as how astronomy education and research differs around the world. Alex worked as a researcher at the Cerro-Tololo Observatory in Chile and an Astronomy Ambassador with the American Astronomical Society. Most recently, he interned at the International Astronomical Union’s Office of Astronomy for Development in South Africa aiding in astroinformatics outreach. Alex hopes to enter graduate school next year, studying gravitational waves and communicating the beauty of the cosmos to others."
