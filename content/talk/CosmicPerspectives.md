abstract = "Our current age of globalization has made it possible for international collaborations to thrive, and nowhere is this more evident than in astronomy. Growing networks such as the VLBA and the AVN have led to the construction of science centers in traditionally underserved communities, and low levels of light pollution in these areas provide favorable conditions for optical telescopes as well. For these reasons, astronomy provides an opportunity for economic development around the world. South Africa is a perfect example of this, as will be explored in more depth in this talk. Almost paradoxically, astronomy can be used to preserve regional culture as much as it can be used to promote global connectivity. As the oldest scientific discipline, nearly all societies are rooted in a rich history of astronomical heritage. Astronomical heritage within Gabon, United States, and China will be discussed as case studies. If we are to use astronomy to relate the past to the future, it is crucial that we make it accessible for every member of a society. We conclude by exploring efforts to bring the stars to the visually impaired, including a sonification-based astronomy exhibit called Sounds of the Spectrum that will be featured at the Story Of Space."
