I had been waiting for the hotel shuttle to take me to my next hotel for maybe 5 minutes when a tour guide appeared and asked me where I was going. He was persistant, but I was not determined to get suckered into paying too much. He won. As it turned out, the shuttle I was trying to take was going to the wrong Holiday Inn. So now here Steven and I are, sitting in traffic, talking about our lives (He actually gave me the best price out of anyone I could find, R400).

At the next hotel, I checked in and tried to respond to an email from Dr. Okouma. The internet was out. He'd been trying to contact me to set up a skype session with some other members of Nommo Astronomia, the astronomical society in Gabon, but I had been traveling around too often to make it happen. Back at the concierge desk I asked if they knew of any fun things in the immediate area, desperate to shake Steven who was currently was sitting in the lobby. He was a great guy to talk to, but I was worried he was going to rip me off. The woman behind the counter thinks for a minute, then shrugs and says, "I can't think of a single thing. Sorry." Isn't that the whole point of a concierge desk? You've let me down, lady.

Steven continued discussing his history in the car together. His father died after getting swept up in the anti-apartheid movement when he was young, and his mom sold homemade cheap beer to try and get him and his siblings through school. A liter of the stuff would go for 10 cents; the money only got him to 7th grade. After that, he dropped out to join the police force. He's since worked a bit for a hotel and then became a tour guide. I asked him if he ever thought about going back to school and he says he has, but he never will. He's in his fifties now with kids of his own, and he'd rather make money to get them through school so that they'll never have to make the same decisions he did. I quickly softened towards him. Of course everyone trying to make money off of tourists has their own backstories for it, but it was still sad to hear it firsthand.

The apartheid museum was massive. Based on your entrance ticket, you were randomly assigned a color: "white" or "nonwhite". This determined your path through the museum, obviously emulating Apartheid segregation. I fell asleep during a good majority of the intro movie - damn jetlag - but I remember them talking about how legislation in Apartheid South Africa changed all the time classifying people as "white", "nonwhite", "colored", or "native". They called it the "Chameleon Dance" because people would change "colors" all the time, at least in the eyes of the laws. The stories of prisoners were unsurprisingly tragic; it's insane to think that this all happened so recently.

After lunch I visited Gold Reef Park across the street, an abandoned gold mine turned amusement park. It was R200 to get into the mine tour, which only lasted around 20 minutes. There wasn't much to it, but the gold pouring demonstration afterwards was surprisingly enjoyable!

When I got back to the hotel, though, the struggle to find dinner began. Turns out the hotel restaurant was closed by the time I got there (5pm?) and no restaurant was within walking distance. Steven had already left, so the hotel gave me a list of restaurants from which I could order delivery. I called from my room - or at least, tried, only to find that my phone was broken. So I went to order online instead - and then remembered that the internet was out. Turns out the wifi worked in the hallways, so I sat on my phone outside my room ordering the food. 30 minutes later I followed up with concierge, and they said no order was placed! So I used their phone to call and place another order, and then waited in the lobby until it came. For some reason they had put me down as "Omar", and when they got to the hotel they tried to give the food to someone else!

Hungry and tired, I ran upstairs with the meal. There was nothing but soda on the menu, so I figured I could try out my water filter in the sink of my room. I filled up the sink, plopped in the hose, started pumping, and water shot out directly onto my face and shirt. Turns out some assembly is required. I filled my Nalgene and went to eat dinner while the iodine tablets dissolved. I had ordered a "bunny chow", a thick stew served in a bread bowl that Henry had heard about. Mine didn't have any bunny in it; I couldn't tell you why they call it that. They gave me no silverware, so I scooped it out with the tin foil in which it came. In a damp shirt. Not my finest moment. I popped back out into the hallway just long enough to ask my dad to book my next night at another hotel, and then went to sleep.
