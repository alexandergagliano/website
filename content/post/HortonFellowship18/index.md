I don’t know if it was dust or humidity or what, but I could not sleep that entire miserable night. I woke up at all hours gasping and coughing. At 4am, my throat stinging, I went wandering before I realized I had finished the last of my bottled water. Luckily I rummaged through my groceries and drank some of the now room-temperature yogurt I had bought that now sat beside my bed.
By the morning, I was sure I had pulmonary TB. Web MD is a dangerous game. I went back to my other house, where there was still no power, and laid in the heat wheezing on the couch for a good part of the morning. At about noon, I finally decided to leave the house. I set off with my camera and took a few pictures around the campus. While I was sneaking about in the forest behind my house I heard a man shouting to me “galio, galio, galio!” This was definitely not a word in French, and I assumed he was trying to tell me that I wasn’t allowed to be back there so I pretended not to hear him.

But he was insistent. He walked up to the fence behind me and continued to call out, “galio, galio, galio!” Finally I turned around and walked back to him. He was a young man, maybe late 20’s, wearing basketball shorts and a sleeveless shirt. Between his fingertips, he cradled a weathered basketball. He smiled and asked me if I wanted to play with him. And I did!

I am absolutely terrible at basketball, but thankfully so was he. We played horse; neither of us made a single shot. His name was Prime. It was from him that I learned that Gabon has no laws regarding downloading of pirated movies, tv shows, music, etc. IIIIIIIIIIIInteresting. I also learned that a little kid he asked said my name was “Galio” instead of “Gagliano” so that was what he called me.

 A bit later, I left to pop into Mr. Chekoubi’s office to explain the struggle of a night I had. We went for a walk so that he could show me around, and we stopped at a few boutiques along the way. The little shop nearest the campus are run by two really nice Nigerian teenagers who give you a free drink every time you buy something! I picked up some manioc wrapped in a banana leaf, which was WEIRD, and Chekoubi bought some food for his post-sunset feast (he was Muslim, and it’s the middle of Ramadan).
Finally, I gave Mr. Seck a call and he told me I could move into my new place. Of the new house:

# Pros:                                                            
* They filled the fridge with water bottles (and beer?)            
* They gave me plates and forks and silverware and a               
microwave                                                         
* Closer to Sylla/Chekoubi/the university
* I’m not paying for housing which is insane                      

# Cons:
* The mattress is quite painful
* No A/C in the main room-no wifi like the old place
* Haven't figured out how to wash my clothes yet

Seck moved me in and then used this gadget he kept in his pocket to punch me out a local sim card to fit in my Galaxy. Turns out that the power didn’t “go out” at all in my old place, they just stopped paying for it because they hadn’t expected me to still be living there. Lovely. We went deep into town to see a man at a shop about giving me more electricity (the world is strange) and then I settled in for the night. Chekoubi and I went over to Sylla’s house, the goofy Nigerian professor, and he made us crepes while we watched the French version of the new Star Wars movie.
