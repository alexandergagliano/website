  Things have gone from 0 to 60! I met with a professor the other day, a Moroccan man named Mr. Chekoubi, who gave me a quick tour of the new polytechnic institute. The facilities are small but quite good. After the tour, Chekoubi sat me down in his office and asked me my plan. I had thought that I was going to be working with high school teachers, but none of them had gotten back to me, so I had no idea what to say. Trying to think on my feet, I told him:

“Well, I’d like to talk to the university students about some basics of astronomy and maybe do a single activity, and then hopefully get a smaller focus group together of a few really motivated kids that I could train in the astronomy activities I had planned so that we have a team to collaborate with Nommo on the outreach for the high school and the general public.”

And then he agreed to pull together 10 of his best students to help me! Just like that!

Mr. Chekoubi booked the main lecture room for Mercredi from 1400-1600. So now I was tasked with choosing any topic in astronomy, creating a presentation for it in French, and finding an age-appropriate activity to go along with it. Oh, and it had to be two hours long.

I decided to talk about exoplanet detection, because I found a pretty cool interactive lab online that the students could work through. I didn’t end up using the interactive lab because the internet wasn’t strong enough, but I found another outreach activity deriving Kepler’s third laws from the orbits of the moons of Jupiter and decided to use that instead. It took me forever to translate the worksheets to French, but once I did I met with Chekoubi and he corrected a few French errors in my presentation. Always have trouble with those masculine/feminine words!

Mercredi came and by 1400 only a single student had showed up. Great. I looked to Mr. Chekoubi expectantly, and he told me to wait a few minutes. Time passes more slowly in Africa, remember? By 1430, 25-30 students had arrived, and  decided to start. And guess what? I DID IT. No doubt I got derailed at a few points, and I misused a few words, but in general I’m quite happy with how it went. I was able to freely articulate my ideas in French instead of just following a memorized script, and I really felt in the zone. The students were answering my questions and they seemed engaged throughout the entire thing! I was on top of the world. The real curveball came when we had no aux cable and so I couldn't play the videos I had prepared. Instead, I had to explain the basic premise of gravitational microlensing myself. Talk about circumlocution.

After the lecture, I asked for anyone that was interested in helping me with my research could write their emails on a piece of paper. I got 21 emails! There were maybe 40 people there by the end of the talk. There was one student who even asked if I had ever lived in France because I spoke French so well! All in all, an exciting first lecture.


ALSO gravitational waves were detected for the second time! I won’t get into it for brevity’s sake, but that’s amazing.
