It is said that time moves more slowly in Africa, and it is correct. I’ve spent the past few days reading and memorizing constellations (take the arc to Arcturis and the spike to Spica), but things have yet to pick up with the outreach. Dr. Okouma, my main collaborator, is in South Africa on other business, so I have been keeping myself busy with background reading and exploring with my camera. I found online a comprehensive study of Fang mythology, the people to the north of Gabon. I read one of the myths to Felix, who was Fang, while he was cooking dinner. He loved it! He laughed and got excited and finished my sentences. It was so rewarding to see him connect to the mythology like that. It also represented a monumental victory for me because the myth was written in English, and I translated it into French in real time while I read it to Felix.

Day 11 marked the end of exams for the Lycée! There was an end of the year ceremony by the track to commemorate the hard work of the students. They started by singing the national anthem of Gabon, and then the school anthem. A few uniformed students acted out skits about going to school while the rest laughed. Later on, two students in fedoras did a dance to a series of Michael Jackson songs! I only wish high school graduations in the United States were that cool.

When the time came to recognize the students, each one was called up, their name read, and their final marks in each class announced (THAT I’m glad they don’t do in the US). Then the Minister of Education (or something like that) would kiss them on each cheek and give them a gift particular to each child’s main focus. If a student wants to go into sports education, they gave him a soccer ball or a basketball. A kid who wanted to go into art got a canvas. I assume that’s what they were, anyway; the gifts were wrapped up. What a marvelous idea! I’m jealous. Many adults there donned the same shirt with a young man’s face on it. Felix later told me that it was Mme Le President’s son, who had passed away recently.

For the rest of the day I’ll just be sending emails and calling people from the astro society here to set something up. ALSO I don’t have any shampoo or conditioner so out of desperation this morning I just scrubbed my hair with a bar of soap and you know what? It actually worked like a charm! My hair feels great! Have I been deceived into buying 3 different products that all do the same thing? Stay woke.
