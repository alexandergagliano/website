Ma dernière jour en Afrique du Sud! I decided I wanted to bungee jump from the Orlando towers in Soweto with my few hours left, but unfortunately they didn’t offer jumps on Mondays. Steven and I went to the towers anyway and they let me head to the top for R70 (maybe $5?). I got into a shaky metal cage with a man in a suit, and he threw a lever. The cage slowly climbed higher and higher, rattling the entire way up. The scariest part wasn’t the height, it was the fact that the track was inclined. The cage was tilted toward the tower so you felt like you were going to slide out the entire time. At the top, though, the view of Soweto was absolutely incredible. You really got a feel for the township as a whole, from the matchbox houses to the massive hospital. Every time the wind blew, the bridge connecting the towers swayed.

Steven took me to Constitution Hill with my last 2 hours, a prison where Mandela and Gandhi were both held after their resistance. They let us go into the solitary confinement cells and, on the backs of the doors, prisoners had scratched messages of all kinds: “Let me die”, “Black power”, “[so and so] was here”. No replicas, no reenactments, real etchings made by real prisoners who stood where I stood. I shivered.

I checked in for my flight after a quick goodbye to Steven and began my trip to Ethiopia. On the way, a kid working for the Airline handed me a voucher for a free night at an Ethiopian hotel! AND they were paying for my dinner and breakfast the next morning! Airlines do that??
In Addis Ababa, I sat at the counter waiting for the shuttle when the man behind the counter started talking to me. The conversation, in a nutshell:

Him: “I don’t think Donald Trump would make a good president for the United States.” [I’m nodding] “I mean, I ALSO hate all the Muslims, but that’s just not the way to go about doing it.” [I stop nodding]

The shuttle arrives and two other men and I shuffle in. I get to talking to one of them, and explain to him the astronomy work I’m trying to do in Gabon and why I think it’s important. He replies, “My brother, I think you are right. We all learned about the stars when we were kids but then we never got to go to them.” (I’m paraphrasing, but only a little) I thought that phrasing was beautiful. People are quickly taught that astronomy is a theoretical discipline with little application, especially in developing countries where short term demands usually beat out long term goals. His words gave me new confidence to follow through with my work in Gabon to the best of my ability.

At the hotel, I ate a buffet-style dinner with the two men from the shuttle. We talked about pretty much everything they could think of: politics, religion, cultural differences. We split a bottle of red wine as they explained their belief systems and I explained mine. It marked the first time I consciously recognized being comfortable traveling alone, and being grateful for it!
