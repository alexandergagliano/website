They say there comes a time, after all of the planning has been done, the preparations set in place, and the logistics firmly established, that you can sit back and watch your plan elegantly unfold. They are wrong. The morning of May 30th had arrived, and my passport had vanished into thin air. My flight out of the country to begin my pilgrimage to Gabon was the evening of May 31st. This, as you could probably imagine, was a very bad thing. Over a year of planning for various hypotheticals, and my entire trip still winds up hanging by a thread 24 hours from takeoff.

Murmurs through various online forums spoke of an expedited passport service for my exact situation. I called up the main office in DC, only to find that their first availability was on June 8th. No luck. In a last minute act of desperation, my dad told me to show up at the passport office as early as possible the next morning, without an appointment, and beg to have a new one made. So 330am, May 31st, my alarm goes off and I'm out the door. I arrived at 5am, 3 hours before the office actually opened. To my amazement, a line had already begun to form outside the building! 8 hours of waiting and $200 later I left with a new passport in hand. I couldn't believe it. Quite a handy resource to know about! I would have been more ecstatic at the time had I been smart enough to shove some granola bars into my pocket that morning, but I felt nothing but exhaustion. It's amazing how a few pages can make or break even the best laid plans - or, alternatively, my plans.

Four hours later, I was on my overnight to Paris. I had just 14 hours to get in as many of the sights as I could, and I used every last one of them. From the Eiffel tower, to the Arc de Triomphe, to sneaking down side streets and popping into patisseries, my time in Paris was a whirlwind of culture. Most of my time was spent wandering and just seeing what I found, which led me to the beautiful Jardin des Tuileries. I sat down with a crepe and watched people pass by for a bit, needing a break from running around. It was there that it finally dawned on me that the next three and a half months I would spend traveling alone. It was a weird feeling. Life for me has always been about shared experience, and I wondered how different of a trip this one would be without someone at my side every step of the way.

With the crepe finished, I walked on in search of something new. Less than 5 minutes had gone by before I realized I had left my NASA drawstring bag back in the park. I ran back to find four police officers walking around the area and talking into walkie talkies, and a fifth one beginning to rope of the area with police tape. There, in the middle of the group, sat my bag. Stuffed with packs of polaroid film, the bag was stretched to accommodate what seemed to be a solid cube inside it. It looked to them like a bomb. I quickly explained (in French) my mistake to the police and they reluctantly let me retrieve the bag. I felt guilty for worrying them; no doubt they were nervous after the recent bombings.

After a quick museum tour, I met up with Gersande, Gabi's friend from Peru, and her friend at a bar for a quick drink. It was the perfect way to decompress after a perfect day. I stayed for longer than I should have, appreciating the conversation, before jumping on the metro back to the airport. Paris was surreal, and hours after leaving it was hard to believe I had been there. Tomorrow morning, I arrive in Johannesburg for a 4 day layover. I'm still not sure what I'll be doing there, nor have I found a place to stay for 3 out of the 4 nights. Okay, so maybe I didn't do so much planning for the layovers. But that's all part of the adventure!
