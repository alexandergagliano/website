I’m learning a great deal about the culture and mythology here from conversations with the maid’s children - or at least, they want me to think I am. A young girl came in one morning to sweep and ended up sitting on the couch talking to me about the wildest things. She said that it was a dangerous secret but that all the important people in Gabon (even the president) go to this club called “La Loge”. They dance and drink, but also do some sort of voodoo witchcraft business. They wear rings with symbols of human eyes on them and try to control their enemies, or something like that. She also discussed her faith, and from my interactions so far it seems that the majority of Gabonese people are highly religious.

Dr. Okouma explained to me that I would be moving to another house for the rest of the summer. There would be no more maid or chef service, and I would have to pay for my electricity from here on out. I didn’t mind, I was still just thrilled to not be paying for the housing. As it turns out, I didn’t move out at all that day. I left to go get ahold of some telescopes that were rumored to be somewhere around the campus, and Mr. Seck explored the classrooms with me. In the very last room we tore apart (of course), we came upon them: 200 Galileoscopes unopened in the corner!

I was amazed to see so many telescopes available but unused. Was the cloud coverage every night really too bad to ever take one out, or were there just not enough teachers interested in leading a lesson with them?

Mr. Seck gave me 2 to assemble and then took me to the grocery store. Or so I thought. Turns out Seck knows every single person in Libreville, because we stopped at a pizzeria on the way so that he could chat up the owners. He talked to pretty much everybody in the grocery store, and then we stopped at a street vendor on the way home where he bought me the spiciest sausage I have ever eaten in my life. After that was an Airtel vendor where he added credit onto his cell phone, and then back to the pizzeria for more conversation. And also a bit of pizza.


He dropped me off at my place by nightfall, where there had been no power all day. A woman came by and told me that I could sleep in another house just for the night, so I scrambled to bring my bag and dinner over. I couldn’t find a fridge, so my groceries sat beside my bed while I ate the massive bowl of spaghetti that Felix had prepared for me: my final meal before I would start cooking for myself.
