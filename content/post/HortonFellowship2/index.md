Day 2! Landing at OR Tambo in Johannesburg, I paid a courier to show me to my hotel (turns out it was across the street) and collapsed onto my bed. The concierge told me about a cultural tour to Soweto, a poor township where Nelson Mandela had lived for a time, and I decided to take it. 

Henry, my tour guide, was there to pick me up an hour later. He was a man unlike any I'd ever met, and one whom I imagine to be the archetypal white South African. His accent was close to that of an Englishman, but his booming voice and jovial disposition reminded me for some reason of an Irishman. He told me he used to play rugby when he was in school. It was fascinating to listen to him talk - he rolled his tongue when teaching me words in Afrikaans, and he would say "There's the way!" whenever he could. Did you have a good meal? There's the way! Manage to spot a jaguar on the trek? There's the way! As I've found to be true of all friendly people from South Africa, he called all women he encountered "mama" and all men "baba". On the ~45 minute drive to Soweto, he  spoke of his time in the brass band during his 2 year military service, and then of his time as a paramedic/search and rescue volunteer. Because rioting and violence was common back then, him and his men painted a bulletproof military truck white to serve as their ambulance. This presented a unique problem: If someone were to shoot into the truck during a rescue, the bullet would bounce around the interior of the truck and wreak havoc. To get around this, they made the floor of the ambulance removable. During a rescue, they would drive over the victim, pull out the floor and, "if he wasn't too big, we hauled him right up!" He didn't offer their backup plan if a victim was too big. Yikes.
We made a quick stop at a local restaurant that served traditional food. Being so close to so many animals, South Africans LIVE for their meats. I had lamb, beef, and chicken, along with a thick maize porridge called mielepap that had no real taste to it. Mielepap is everywhere in South Africa.

From there, it was a short walk to Nelson Mandela's former house. Mandela is hugely respected in South Africa, and often referred as "Tata Madiba" (father Madiba, his clan name). He was educated as a lawyer, and many say there won't be another president as well-educated for a very long time. In contrast, the current president Zuma, so I'm told, gets confused when discussing the economic status of the country. More on him later. Scorch marks stained the ceiling and bullet holes littered the walls of this little brick house, souvenirs of a much more divided country than today. It's incredible that a man symbolizing peace and love could have been so despised by anyone. Of course, there were many who wanted to maintain the Apartheid power hierarchy that he set out to dismantle.

After Mandela's house, we explored a museum on the history of Soweto, the epicenter of much of the student protests against Apartheid. In particular, students demanded that they be taught in their native language of Zulu instead of the Dutch-imposed Afrikaans. Afrikaans, if you've never heard it, is this fascinating hybrid of Dutch, French, and a few other romance languages. When Henry spoke it, it sounded like words from these languages had been haphazardly cut and pasted together to form the new language - the ransom note of imperialist powers. It was forbidden to take any pictures in the museum because, according to Henry, "The Dutch think it makes them look bad." How absurd that this type of censorship is allowed! And what a cruel irony that, despite the abolition of Apartheid and the growth of an independent South Africa, it's still the white man that gets to control the narrative.

I was halfway through the museum when a massive group of young schoolchildren in matching green outfits swarmed the halls. We crossed paths as I was about to take the stairs back down to the bottom floor. A young girl at the head of the group looked at the stairs and then at me and asked, "Can we go down?" I shrugged. The whole group burst out laughing and charged down the steps.


After the tour, which cost me about 1200 Rand, Henry drove me back to the hotel and I headed back out for dinner. Henry had mentioned "Emperor's Palace" as a good place to eat, so I took the shuttle there and popped into the first restaurant I found. I was halfway through a warthog steak and mielepap (treating myself), when two middle-aged women waved me over to sit with them. I did, and we exchanged introductions. We talked for a bit, but soon it became clear how drunk they were. Things went from bad to worse when one of them started getting handsy, and by the time they were debating which of them was going to go home with me I politely excused myself. 

Delicious steak, though!

Back at the hotel, I booked another night's stay with the points on my IHG account. Last Christmas I was not having it with my Dad making me fill out notecards for a points promotion, but as much much as I hate to admit it the hot shower and the cozy mattress now had me beyond grateful. Tomorrow, Henry is going to lead me and a Singaporean family on a trek through Pilanesburg reserve!
