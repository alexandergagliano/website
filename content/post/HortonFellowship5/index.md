Today started at the Satyagraha house, where Gandhi stayed for most of his 21 years living in South Africa. It was here that he developed his philosophy of peaceful resistance, and he practiced this in opposition to apartheid in South Africa. Satyagraha is a juxtaposition of two words – “satya”, meaning “the truth”, and “graha”, meaning “to seize hold of”.

I’m thrilled we went. We took a brief tour of Gandhi’s living quarters, where he mainly spun fabric and read. Large metal slabs with his handwritten quotes engraved in them were situated around the grounds. It was calm and peaceful and beautiful, and with more time I’d love to have actually stayed there (they turned it into a B&B). As an homage to his life, they offer introductory yoga and meditation classes, as well as tea breaks in the garden. Apparently it’s not a common tourist attraction at all, so I was glad to have chosen it.

Next, Paul and I went into Newtown. He stayed with me the entire time instead of just dropping me off, and together we grabbed a meal in the food court of the mall nearby. Mielepap and steak, of course! We toured Museum Africa, an enormous collection of the most eclectic exhibits. At the ground floor we walked through an exhibition of photography by a South African staying in Denmark. The beautiful photos were mainly of strangers, and I resolved to ask more strangers to take their picture. Past that was a hall dedicated to Apartheid artifacts, and then one on traditional African medicine. Next, we walked through a hall whose walls traced the development of the digital camera and also the movie making industry. We finished at a geology exhibit, and then headed back to the hotel.

Paul dropped me off at the complex near my hotel so I wouldn’t be scrambling for a place to eat at the last minute again. He dropped me in the middle of a set of shops, but something seemed off. It was just before 5pm, and every place was closed. The grocery store, the restaurants, the pharmacy, everything. And I don’t just mean they had shut down for the day. The entire place was utterly devoid of life, and most of the places were padlocked and wrapped in chains.

I wandered for a bit, confused. Finally, a man popped out from behind a building and started toward me in the parking lot. I jogged over to talk to him, but when we reached each other he only looked at me in silence through cloudy, lifeless eyes. Dead silence. He held up a sign to me that certified that he was deaf and blind, and asking me for some change. I gave him a bit and he wandered off smiling. I started to wonder how he had known I was there when my hunger brought me back to the present.


Walking onward, I finally came upon a sports bar by the name of “Mama Rockets” – or something like that. I walked inside to find it full of people, sound, and life, like I had imagined the last post-apocalyptic 20 minutes. I ordered a massive burger and a carafe of wine and was soon hit with the deeply uncomfortable realization that everyone eating at the restaurant was white, and everyone working at the restaurant was black. The de facto segregation of Johannesburg was still prevalent in most places I had gone, to varying degrees.

After I paid the bill, I hopped across the highway back to my hotel. Strange day!
