My shuttle back to the airport was at 545am, so I was quite sleepy by the time I boarded my final flight. With the last few minutes on the plane, I finally got my first view of Gabon. It truly looked like a country that had sprung up from the middle of the rainforest. For every house, there were two palm trees. The houses seemed simple and inexpensive, but their florescent facades only contributed to the overall beauty. The landscape reminded me of forests of Vietnam as portrayed in any of the many Vietnam War movies.

The second I turned the corner into our gate, I saw three people holding a sign with my name on it. One, a woman in maybe her 30’s, disappeared with the sign the second I identified myself. The other two, a man in a suit and a beautiful young woman in holding an impressive leather folder, helped me from there. They took care of my bag, my visa, and customs, telling everybody that I was “L’astronaute des Etats-Unis”.

The woman called for transportation and sent me off in a van. After several stops along the way and me falling asleep for most of them, we came upon the Lycée Berthe et Jean d’Essassa. A woman was at the door to see me in. She was impressed with my French and showed me inside. The place I was staying was a small house, with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room. The woman introduced me to _my maid_, and said that my food would be coming later. I was amazed at the level of accommodation! I had assumed I’d be in something like a dorm, figuring things out for myself.

A man named Felix knocked at the door soon after and brought in some food. Turns out Felix is _my chef_ – I nervously asked if the meals were just for today, and he laughed and told me he’d make me breakfast, lunch, and dinner for as long as I was staying there. I couldn’t believe it. I kept thanking him, but deep down I felt guiltier and guiltier with each new luxury. I had done nothing here yet, was just some twenty-something student passing through and already I was living better than nearly everyone we had driven past on the way there. The pervasive feeling of reward without work, about which Gandhi in his Satyagraha had warned, overcame me, and for the rest of the day I asked Felix if I could help clean or do dishes or anything at all to help earn my keep. He shook his head each time, saying “You have your work and I have mine.”

I spent the rest of the day planning astronomy activities. Excited but already feeling the pressure to succeed, I showered and went to sleep.
