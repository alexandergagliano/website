From exploring the hotel a bit the day before, I found a bowl in the gym they keep stocked with fresh fuit. I went in this morning and grabbed a pear on my way out to meet Henry. He was half an hour early, so we had time before picking up our Singaporean travelers to stop by another one of Nelson Mandela's houses. The house in Soweto was small, from his youth; this one was far nicer. Out front, there was a small pile of stones upon which people had left messages of love and support from all over the world. Henry brought with him a marker and a blank stone, and I left a note of my own - a small mark of my time in Johannesburg.

We slowed to a stop in the midst of a major traffic jam on the main road into Pilanesburg. After about 45 minutes, the cause of the jam was made clear: protesting transportation workers. By the time we had gotten through, there were charred tires and stones where they had blocked off the road in demonstration, and along the shoulder we saw two trucks burnt down to their frames. I found out later that they transported goods to and from the mines upon which Johannesburg was built, and they were forced to work in deplorable conditions. They staged a protest back in 2012 where they sat by the mines and refused to work. In response, the government came out and shot them all.

According to the wikipedia page, 47 people were killed in total. Henry says it's not a secret that the government acted criminally. Henry has spoken quite a bit about South African politics as well, and not in the most positive of lights. At the moment, Jacob Zuma is president. He's a member of the ANC party, as Nelson Mandela was, but according to Henry Zuma's a criminal. It's interesting that in South Africa people align much more closely with a candidate than with a party. They loved Mandela, and most don't like Zuma. Zuma apparently stole loads of money from the country of South Africa and built himself a mansion with a pool. When asked where the money came from, Zuma said he took out a loan.

Unafraid of Zuma, some badass woman (I will refer to her from here on out as Judy Justice) had him investigated and found no record of him taking out any loan. She stood up in the middle of parliament, in front of everyone, and said to him: "Mr. President, you are a liar and a thief and I can prove it!" That's awesome. In response, he changed his story and said that actually his sons gave him the money. Mrs. Justice actually goes and talks to the sons, who say they have no idea what he's talking about. Zuma says, "Okay, well the pool was paid for with state appropriated funds, but it's a necessary expense because I conduct important govt. business in that house and if it catches fire the water from the pool will be used to put it out." Insane! Mrs. Justice, fed up at this point, drives to his house to investigate further to find that he's put out fire hoses alongside the pool for draining.

Zuma has been tried by the highest court in SA and found unanimously guilty of stealing money, but parliament is a majority members of his own party so they won't impeach him. Another thing worth mentioning: He underwent trial in 2005 after being accused of raping a woman he knew. He claimed it was consensual. The accuser was a well known HIV-positive AIDS activist, and Zuma (who was then head of the national AIDS council) admitted to not wearing a condom even though he knew she was HIV positive. That was okay because, according to him, he showered afterwards. HIV rates shot up in SA in the years after as his followers took showering to be a legitimate form of HIV prevention. There are more than a few outrageous things that happen around the world that we dont hear about in the US, as I'm learning.

The group of Singaporean travelers were Benny, the father; Phoebe, the daughter; and Eileen, the mother. They were a goofy group and I was thrilled to get to travel with them for the day! On the road to the reserve, Benny asked Henry about the business structure of running a tourism agency. Benny talked a lot about different business structures. I never asked him what he did for a living, but I could've ventured a guess.

We finally arrived at the reserve and started on an enormous lunch. It had fruit, vegetables, LOTS of game meat, and pretty much everything else you can imagine. I was starving by the time I got there (the single pear didn't sate me, as it turned out), and I ate much too much, much too quickly. As we were about to leave a pair of little birds, their fluorescent feathers shimmering in the hot African sun, flew down and landed on Henry's plate.

After lunch, Henry sent us off with another tour guide and the trek began. We saw lions, wildebeests (they really do look exactly like in the Wild Thornberrys and I'm sorry for the reference), impala, rhinos, warthogs (according to Benny they knew about my steak the night before), elephants, and zebra. The second half of the trek, I saw some beautiful giraffe setting out toward the watering hole. The entire scene was as surreal as anything I had ever seen. Looking out over the seemingly endless landscape, ever alive with rustling wildlife, a happiness washed over me. A brief thought fluttered through my mind that maybe sitting at a computer reducing astronomy data wasn't how I wanted to spend my days. After all, as Henry says, "you go back to your soul when you're in the bush."

Night fell soon after, and I was huddling under a blanket against the wind by the time we made it back into camp. We all slept the entire car ride back. I booked a night at the Holiday Inn Express Sandton for the next night with most of my remaining points; it definitely won't be as luxurious as here, but at least I don't have to pay for it!
