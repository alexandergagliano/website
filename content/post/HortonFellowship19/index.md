After washing some of my clothes in the sink and eating some more of Felix’s spaghetti for breakfast (the gift that keeps on giving), I set off to do some research. I sat outside the library trying to find a connection when one of the students came up to me. I recognized him from my exoplanet talk. He told me he wanted to practice his English, so he spoke in English while I responded in French. We talked mainly about languages and his future. He said he wanted to go into robotics, but that there were no opportunities for him in Gabon.

When I walked back home for lunch (guess what I had? FELIX’S SPAGHETTI), I found Sylla out front of his house working on a car. And by car, I mean more of a golf cart. We hung out for a bit and then I went off to take some more pictures. By my old house, I came upon a man out front trying to catch a feral tabby cat. I helped him for a bit but was wary of his motives, as he was pretty aggressive in trying to catch him/her. The cat ran off and fell into a storm drain, so I crawled in, with him watching on the other side, to get him/her out. I was nearly at the cat when the man at the other side of the drain snatched it. The cat started clawing at his hand and he flailed it around in response, trying to shake the cat off. I screamed at him in French to stop. The cat dove off, landing on solid ground, and then scurried into the bushes. So much for helping out.

Sylla and I took a stroll down the street leading up to the ecole. We got to the boutique with the Nigerian boys and Sylla instructed me to buy a pack of these British mint “bonbons”, which would help with my coughing. He says he had the same issue for about a week when he moved here because the humidity was so extreme. Back at home, he dropped 4 of the bonbons into some mint tea and let them dissolve. It worked like magic – by the end of the mug my sinuses were clear and my lungs were grateful.

I ate dinner at Sylla’s place, savory crepes. I’m glad I’ve become so close with the professors here; the time would have passed by much more slowly without their company. He saw me drawing in my journal and decided to draw a picture of me, which is a masterpiece. To be added to the blog! The movie he put on didn’t work, so he invited over a student who brought with him a laptop full of downloaded movies.
What resulted, instead of a film, was a several hour long conversation about African spirits and belief systems. I didn’t turn it into a formal interview, because I wasn’t getting too much about astronomy, but I hear stories of spirits of the forest and spirits of the sea. They told me of sirens and mermaids and spells that can bind your feet together or make you fall in love. They also said that those who have organized religion, regardless of the religion, are protected against spells. In exchange, they must make a vow to cast no spells unto others. I recorded the second half of the conversation on my phone. What was fascinating to me was how casually they discussed it, like there was nothing out of the ordinary about it at all. They just shrugged and said, “this stuff just happens in Africa.”

I’ve been thinking more about why I am here, the research I am trying to do. I’m in a situation in which I have never been before: In a foreign country, alone, loose plans, with only my search for astronomy outreach and mythology to guide me. Without the rigidity of a formal program or Dr. Okouma’s instruction it is my motivation to which I cling, which propels me forward. When I meet people, I explain that I am a traveler on a journey, in search of something very specific. I feel like the child in The Alchemist during his time working in the China shop. I know that this time is temporary, and that I must be patient until I see the next clear direction to take, but at the moment I am restless and anxious to make progress.
