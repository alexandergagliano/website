There are 62 different ethnic groups in Gabon, a county with only 2 million people. As a result, the culture across the country is beautifully diverse. 

One of the prominent traditional religions in Gabon is called Bwiti. It is practiced by many different ethnic groups, but its largest congregation is the Fang people to the north. During a ceremony I was able to witness, Fang initiates were adorned with images of the sun, the moon, and the stars. The chieftain also wore a shirt with these images (see top picture). These objects represent the invisible world of spirits, and the knowledge gained from initiation.  

The Tsogo people in central Gabon use astronomy predominantly in names. It is said that Tsogo people who lead a moral life will become a star after death, so children are named after objects in the sky, such as Ngonde, the moon and Mononga, the star, to give them good luck in life. In such close proximity to the Congolese rainforest, Tsogo culture is also intimately connected to the forest (as is the culture of many other ethnic groups in the country).

In the south of Gabon are the Bahoumbou, who say that any crops planted will take on the attributes of their environment. Because of this, cassava, a popular tuber in West Africa, can only be planted when the moon is waxing or waning. This allows it to grow its healthy crescent shape, mimicing that of the moon.
