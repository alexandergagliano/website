With the number of different private companies racing to develop autonomous vehicle technology,
largely in secret, the exact implementation and implications of this software is unknown. It is therefore
crucial to identify abilities and behaviors shared by all types of autonomous vehicles, which will reduce
travel times and danger to the users. With the potential for communication between other autonomous
vehicles, these cars will be able to mimic travel patterns of different species of animal, such as a school
of fish. The behaviors that allow animals to travel efficiently in groups, which can also be developed
in autonomous vehicles, are defined by Boid's model of animal flocking:

- Cohesion: An object moves toward the center of mass of similar neighbors.
- Separation: An object moves away from other flocks in order to prevent collision.
- Alignment: An object adjusts its orientation according to the orientation of the flock.

Our model solution implements methods that mimic these 3 vital behaviors.1
Our models find that, with section 10 as an exception, every section of road has its highest throughput at either 0% or 20% autonomous vehicles. At first,
this may seem paradoxical. It is important to recognize, however, that autonomous vehicles were created under the condition that none could attain a speed higher than the speed limit of 60 mph. On the other
hand, the speeds of human-operated vehicles can range from 40 mph to 80mph, with only a mean of 60 mph. This means that any cars moving greater than 60 mph will be slowed down by a bot moving in front
of them. The greater the number of bots on the road, the greater the likelihood that a car moving faster than the speed limit will be slowed down, decreasing the throughput.
