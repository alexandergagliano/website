For thousands of years, we have used our eyes to study the cosmos, but what if we could use our ears, or our hands? What would we learn if we gave everyone a chance to experience our universe? 

The Story of Space is the Story of Energy. All the light that we observe is electromagnetic energy propagating throughout the universe. The building blocks of the universe, atoms, each have their own unique light signature, called an emission spectrum. 

Alex and Jackie take the frequencies of light unique to each element and converts it into an aural frequency. A series of vibrating metal plates allow them to reveal these frequencies as visual patterns. 

By layering the audio and the patterns, they have created new representations of water, humans, the Earth, and even the universe itself.  

In this exhibit, individuals learn to identify the elements by patterns in sound instead of in light. These sounds are then stacked to create a vibrational and auditory representation of a star, the earth, and the human body. 

As part of this exhibit, participants can also walk through a star. As they do, the elements they hear will changed based on the relative abundances of elements at the point where they're standing. We hope this will help people think more creatively about representing
astronomical data in a way that makes the field more accessible for visuallly impaired and blind astronomers.
